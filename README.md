# Me
Site with stuff on it. Me, some games hopefully, writing posts of whatever, projects ive done, and so on.


Issues:
- I cannnot server side render anything so I have to figure out how I can do it for things like Phaser and to do it only once.
- Hydration errors (mismatch in content shown between client and server) makes the above more difficult
- Next.js and keywords makes then Phaser configerations is annoying because where it's placed messes it up
- the Modal file like for some reason only partially works I don't know why I want to assume it is cause Tailwind isn't being applied or some bs  

Goals:
- Fix styling issues
- Finally at the very least have Phaser properly configured or just migrate to something else
- Idk what to add to the website
